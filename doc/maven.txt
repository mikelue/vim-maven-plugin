I. Installation					*maven-plugin-installation*

1. You should get the source from(using Git): >

	git clone git@github.com:mikelue/vim-maven-plugin.git

2. Copy the directories into your 'runtimepath'.

3. Build the help tag(corresponding to your coping destination): >

	helptags ~/vimfiles/doc

4. Read the introduction from this plugin's help.

==============================================================================
1. Introduction					*maven-plugin-introduction*

Execute Maven ~

This section provides a quickguide to the usage of this plugin. You may check
detailing reference at |mave-plugin-reference|.

The |:Mvn| is the main command to execute Maven if your current buffer is
under a Maven project. The detection of Maven is by looking for "pom.xml" file
from ascent directory of buffer. For example: >

	:Mvn package

Unit Test ~

When writing unit test(|maven-tutorial-writing-unittest)|, this plugin provides
some useful features to edit and run files across source files of main/test
code.

Functions ~

There are a dozen of functions published by this plugin(|autoload|) in case you want to
write scripts within Maven's context. See |maven-plugin-function|.

==============================================================================
1.1. Execute Maven command		*maven-tutorial-execute*

Execution ~

|:Mvn| execute the phases/goals as options provided by Vim's command. The
command would open |quickfix-window| if the result of execution has errors.
Moreover, if you want to execute Maven from scratch, add a |<bang>| to command
gives you a |shell-window| which as runing from your shell.

For example: >
	:Mvn compile " Execute the 'compile' phase of Maven
	:Mvn! compile " Execute the 'compile' phase of Maven with opening shell window

Error Message ~

|:Mvn| is implemented by |write-compiler-plugin|. And this plugin try to setup
'errorformat' as possible as to recognize the output of Maven. The
'errorformat', however, may not be compatible with untested version of Maven,
as well as the compiler/surefire plugins.

If the exeuction of |:Mvn| has failed, this plugin would call |copen| to
disply the output of Maven. The information from Maven would be omitted for
following formats:
	1) [INFO] message...
	2) [debug] messages...
	3) The rest of message following "[INFO] BUILD FAILURE"

And following formats of message would be put into |quickfix|:
	1) [ERROR] messages...
	2) [WARNING] messages...
	3) Failed tests: ...

Here are the versions which has been tested for 'errorformat':

	Maven Version: 3.0.X~
	http://maven.apache.org/

	Compiler Plugin Version: 2.3.2~
	http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-compiler-plugin/

	Surefire Plugin Version: 2.11 ~
	http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-surefire-plugin/

If you want to know detail of 'errorformat' of Maven, please see the source
code of "compiler/maven.vim".

Recognize Messages from Maven ~

In |quickfix|, this plugin can recognize following error messages from Maven:

	* Error of POM.xml: >
		The project idv.mikelue:sandbox-java:1.0-SNAPSHOT (D:\Code\sandbox-java\pom.xml) has 1 error
		sandbox-java/pom.xml|10 col 8 error| Unrecognised tag: 'data' (position: START_TAG seen ...</parent>\r\n\r\n\t<data>... @10:8)
<
	* Error/Warning of Compilation(Ignore the lines after '[INFO] BUILD FAILURE'): >
		sandbox-java/src/main/java/idv/mikelue/Car.java|4 col 25 warning| [deprecation] do1() in idv.mikelue.Can has been deprecated
		|| COMPILATION ERROR :
		sandbox-java/src/main/java/idv/mikelue/Can.java|9 col 2 error| cannot find symbol
		|| symbol  : method do3()
		|| location: class idv.mikelue.Can
<
	* Failure of Unit Test(JUnit or TestNG): >
		||
		|| -------------------------------------------------------
		||  T E S T S
		|| -------------------------------------------------------
		|| Running idv.mikelue.CanTest
		|| Tests run: 1, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.407 sec <<< FAILURE!
		||
		|| Results :
		||
		sandbox-java/src/test/java/idv/mikelue/CanTest.java|\<test01\>| Message or test sample expected:<true> but was:<false>
		||
		|| Tests run: 1, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
		||
<

Remember, you could use |:Mvn!| to open the console if you need all of the
output from Maven.

==============================================================================
1.2. Edit Files					*maven-tutorial-edit-files*

When we are editing a new file in Maven, we always need a help to choose the
package of a Java file, which is relevant the path of source code.

|:MvnNewMainFile| give you an eaisier way to edit a file by press |tab| to prompt
the existing package in '{basedir}/src/main/java'.

|:MvnNewTestFile|, as its name implied, give you the hint of package to files under
'{basedir}/src/test/java'.

For example, while you are editing a ".java" file, using following command to
edit a new ".java" file: >

	:MvnNewMainFile org.yourproject NewClass.java " Edit a new file 'NewClass.java' under 'org.yourproject'
	:MvnNewMainFile <Tab> " Give you the existing package in '{basedir}/src/main/java'
	:MvnNewMainFile -p=<Tab> " Give you the list sub-directory of under '{basedir}/src/main/{prefix}'

==============================================================================
1.3. Find Files					*maven-tutorial-find-files*

Locating a file in Maven project is the most used daily routine in
development. With this plugin, once having opend a file which is recognized
under a Maven project, you may a file by VIM's spectacular command |:find|.

Here are examples for finding file/directory: >

	:find Security*<tab> // find "SecurityController.java" in never-remembered package
	:find somefolder/*.properties<tab> // find some files with extension of ".properties" in "somefolder" of tree in Maven
	:find pom.xml // Get the pom.xml file of Maven
<

And you will see the possible files/directories in your Maven project. This is
why the functionality of |g:maven_auto_set_path| is designed into this plugin.

See |:find| for usage of 'path' and |wildcard| for syntax in {file}.

Since this plugin has used |startstart-wildcard| to set 'path', you already
have benefits of searching a directory tree in a Maven project.

See: |maven#getListOfPaths()| for the directories set to 'path' by this
plugin.

==============================================================================
1.4. Options					*maven-tutorial-options*

Setting |g:maven_auto_chdir| to 1, you could change current directory
automatically to the root of Maven project. The Maven context comes from
current focused buffer. The automatic changing directory is triggered by
|BufWineEnter| event.

The 'path' is a useful setting for various functionalities in VIM. This plugin
would set the pre-defined paths based on root of Maven proejct, which uses
|:setlocal| to 'path' while |BufNewFile| or |BufReadPost| is triggered. You
could turn off this function by setting |g:maven_auto_set_path| to 0.

See: |:find|

==============================================================================
1.5. Writing unit test			*maven-tutorial-writing-unittest*

Jump among files ~

While we are writing unit test, there is a plenty of opportunities to jump
between source/unit test files. This plugin provides |key-mapping| to make
programmer jump files more easily.

|maven#switch-unittest-file| is an intricate map let you jump to/from
source/unit test files without trouble of path/file name. It's also ready for
editing a new file with buliding the whole tree of new directory.

Suggestions of mapping >
	if !hasmapto("maven#switch-unittest-file", "in")
		imap <silent> <F6> maven#switch-unittest-file
		nmap <silent> <F6> maven#switch-unittest-file
	endif

Execute unit test ~

In order to execute a single class of testing in Maven, you may use >

	Mvn test -Dtest=%:t:r -DfailIfNoTests=true

to perform testing. However, the |maven#run-unittest| map let you perform
testing in current focused buffer.

Suggestions of mapping >
	if !hasmapto("maven#run-unittest", "in")
		imap <silent> <F5> maven#run-unittest
		nmap <silent> <F5> maven#run-unittest
	endif

Open the result of unit test ~

After testing finished, you may open the test result by command. >
	if !hasmapto("maven#open-test-result", "in")
		imap <buffer> <silent> <C-F6> maven#open-test-result
		nmap <buffer> <silent> <C-F6> maven#open-test-result
	endif

See |maven-tutorial-keystrokes| for suggestion keystorkes of full
configuration to pre-defined maps in this plugin.

==============================================================================
1.6. Maven API  				*maven-tutorial-api*

This plugin has a couple of |user-functions|, you may like to use them for
writing your own script to improve development for Maven.

For example, you might edit snippet of neocomplcache for getting package of
current buffer: >
	package `maven#getJavaPackageOfBuffer(bufnr("%"))`;

	public class `expand("%:t:r")` {
		public `expand("%:t:r")`() {}
	}
<

See: https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplcache-snippets-complete

==============================================================================
1.7. Suggestions of keystrokes  		*maven-tutorial-keystrokes*

Following samples are suggestions of mapping of this plugin: >
	autocmd BufNewFile,BufReadPost *.* call s:SetupMavenMap()

	function! <SID>SetupMavenMap()
		doautocmd MavenAutoDetect BufNewFile,BufReadPost

		if !maven#isBufferUnderMavenProject(bufnr("%"))
			return
		endif

		" Execute testing
		if !hasmapto("maven#run-unittest", "in")
			imap <buffer> <silent> <F5> maven#run-unittest
			nmap <buffer> <silent> <F5> maven#run-unittest
		endif
		" //~)

		" Execute all of testing
		if !hasmapto("maven#run-unittest-all", "in")
			imap <buffer> <silent> <C-F5> maven#run-unittest-all
			nmap <buffer> <silent> <C-F5> maven#run-unittest-all
		endif
		" //~)

		" Switch of unit test
		if !hasmapto("maven#switch-unittest-file", "in")
			imap <buffer> <silent> <F6> maven#switch-unittest-file
			nmap <buffer> <silent> <F6> maven#switch-unittest-file
		endif
		" //~)

		" Open for testing result of testing
		if !hasmapto("maven#open-test-result", "in")
			imap <buffer> <silent> <C-F6> maven#open-test-result
			nmap <buffer> <silent> <C-F6> maven#open-test-result
		endif
		" //~)
	endfunction

==============================================================================
1.8. Limitations of this plugin  	*maven-plugin-limitation*

Directories of Maven ~

The "pom.xml" of Maven supports developer in defining different directories for
various features. However, reading the "pom.xml" file and setup corresponding
information of Maven would be a struggle in VIM. So this plugin currently must
depends on default setting of directories of Maven.

Note: This plugin is dedicated to work on default setting of directories for Maven.

Maven Aggregation and Inheritance ~

This plugin just recognize the "pom.xml" from the closest directory of ancstor,
though Maven supports project aggregation and inheritance.

See: http://maven.apache.org/pom.html#Inheritance
See: http://maven.apache.org/pom.html#Aggregation

==============================================================================
2. Plugin References			*maven-plugin-reference*

The following sections describe detailed information about the commands, map,
and functions which could be used to write plugins that need information of
Maven's context

==============================================================================
2.1. Maven commands				*maven-plugin-command*

								*execute-maven* *:Mvn* *:Mvn!*
:Mvn[!] [maven-options] [maven-goals] <maven-phases>
		This VIM command is a wrapper command for Maven on OS shell. The valid
		options is as same as those defined by Maven.  By default, this
		command would execute Maven in background.  Using [!] to open the
		|shell-window| for execution.

		<maven-phases> is supported as |:command-completion| by this plugin with
		|:command-complete-custom|.

		Example: >
			:Mvn compile " Execute the 'compile' phase of Maven
			:Mvn! compile " Execute the 'compile' phase of Maven with opening shell window

			:Mvn test -Dtest=SomethingTest " Perform the unit test for 'SomethingTest'
			:Mvn resources:resources " Perform the goal "resources:resource' of maven
			:Mvn <Tab> " Auto-complete defined mavne phases

:MvnNewMainFile [-p[refix]={prefix}] [package] [file-name]							*:MvnNewMainFile*
		Edit a new file by input its package and filename, this command would
		build the whole tree of directory or open the existing file. The full path
		of target file would be ascent to '{basedir}/src/main/{{prefix}|{file-extension}}/'.

		The [package], inputted by hand hardly, could be auto-compelted by
		press <|tab|>. The entry directory for searching auto-completion comes
		from {prefix} or the extension of file name of current buffer.

		The [-prefix] option is used to declare the prefix under
		'{basedir}/src/main/{prefix}/' instead of {file-extension}. You may
		use <Tab> to automatically complete existing directories.

		For example: >

			:MvnNewMainFile org.pkgname ClassName.java
			:MvnNewMainFile <Tab> " Auto-completing package coming from {basedir}/src/main/*/**/'
			:MvnNewMainFile -p=resources org.pkgname ClassName.properties " Edit new file under /resources/
			:MvnNewMainFile -p=webapp/WEB-INF org.pkgname ClassName.properties " Edit new file under /webapp/WEB-INF/
			:MvnNewMainFile -p=<Tab> " Auto-completing directories under {basedir}/src/main/*
<
		See: |MvnNewTestFile|

:MvnNewTestFile [-p[refix]={prefix}] [package] [file-name]							*:MvnNewTestFile*
		As same as |:MvnNewMainFile| except looking for the path of file under
		'{basedir}/src/test/{{prefix}|{file-extension}}/'.

		For example: >

			:MvnNewTestFile org.pkgname ClassName.java
			:MvnNewTestFile <Tab> " Auto-completing package coming from {basedir}/src/test/*/**/'
			:MvnNewMainFile -p=resources org.pkgname ClassName.properties
			:MvnNewMainFile -p=<Tab> " Auto-completing directories under {basedir}/src/test/*
<
		See: |:MvnNewMainFile|

:MvnNewTestCode [Test-ClassName]
		Edit test code by [Test-ClassName] which under the package( Note: must be
		in '<project_root>/src/main') of current buffer. You could use |tab|
		to list candidates of class name for test code.

		For example: >
			:MvnNewTestCode <Tab> " List condidates of test file name
<

		If you like to edit a new test file but current buffer is under
		'<project_root>/src/test'
		Just use: >

			:edit %:h/YourNewTest.java
<
		See: |maven-plugin-options-unittest|

==============================================================================
2.2. Maven Maps					*maven-plugin-map*

|mapmode-n| |mapmode-i|				*maven#run-unittest*
maven#run-unittest				Run the unit test for current buffer, same as: >
								:Mvn test -Dtest=%:t:r

|mapmode-n| |mapmode-i|				*maven#run-unittest-all*
maven#run-unittest-all			Run the unit test for current project, same as: >
								:Mvn test

|mapmode-n| |mapmode-i|				*maven#switch-unittest-file*
maven#switch-unittest-file		Switch between source/unit test file. If the
								file doesn't exist, it would ask whether to edit a
								new file or not.

|mapmode-n| |mapmode-i|				*maven#open-test-result*
maven#open-test-result			Open the result of testing by JUnit. See |MvnOpenTestResult|.

==============================================================================
2.3. Maven Functions							*maven-plugin-function*

Most of following functions accept a {a:buf} as the buffer is being processed,
so that these functions is context-free from your editing.

Functions for Maven Information ~

maven#isBufferUnderMavenProject(buf)					*maven#isBufferUnderMavenProject()*
	Check whether a buffer is under a Maven project. This inspection of a
	buffer for Maven is trigger by |BufReadPost| and |BufNewFile| events of
	|autocommand|.

	{a:buf} - The buffer is going to be assessed

maven#getDependencyClasspath(buf)						*maven#getDependencyClasspath()*
	Get the classpaths of dependencies from Maven project. This function uses
	"mvn dependency:build-classpath" to extract the classpath of project.

	You may use this function to setup classpath support by other plugins.
	For example: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1785 give you
	a IDE-like auto-completion while editing java code.

maven#getMavenProjectRoot(buf)							*maven#getMavenProjectRoot()*
	If the {a:buf} is under a Maven project, this function gives you the
	{basedir} of Maven.

	Note: This function returns "" if the buffer is not under a Maven project.

	{a:buf} - The buffer is going to be assessed

maven#setupMavenProjectInfo(buf)						*maven#setupMavenProjectInfo()*
	Inspect and setup the buffer for Maven project. This function should be
	called by |autocommand|. The plugin of Maven has used this function to
	setup a buffer while |BufReadPost| or |BufNewFile| occurs.

	You may use this function to re-inspect a buffer again.

	{a:buf} - The buffer is going to be inspected

maven#getListOfPaths(buf) 								*maven#getListOfPaths()*
	Generate a list of paths which is used to set the 'path'.
	The content of list: >

		{basedir}/src/main/java/**
		{basedir}/src/test/java/**
		{basedir}/src/main/resources/**
		{basedir}/src/test/resources/**
		{basedir}/src/main/webapp/**
		{basedir}/src/test/webapp/**
		{basedir}/src/main/**
		{basedir}/src/test/**
		{basedir}/target/**
		{basedir}
<

	Normally, you don't need this function to setup 'path'. Instead, you
	should use |g:maven_auto_set_path| to control whether to set 'path'
	automatically.

	{a:buf} - The buffer is going to be checked for {basedir}

Functions for Package Information ~

maven#getJavaPackageOfBuffer(buf)						*maven#getJavaPackageOfBuffer()*
	Give you the package of a buffer which has been recognized under a Maven
	project. See: |maven#isBufferUnderMavenProject()|

	{a:buf} - The buffer which is recognized under a Maven project

maven#getClassPathOfBuffer(buf)							*maven#getClassPathOfBuffer()*
	Give you the classpath of buffer which has been recognized under a Maven
	project. This function provides another way to generate classpath in Maven
	project.

	{a:buf} - The buffer which is recognized under a Maven project

maven#convertPathToJavaPackage(filename)				*maven#convertPathToJavaPackage()*
	According to |filename-modifiers|, this function give you the package by
	extracting the path corresponding Maven's rule:
	'/src/(main|test)/{source-folder}/'.

	{a:filename} - The file name of source which is used to extract package

	See: |maven#getJavaPackageOfBuffer()|, |maven#isBufferUnderMavenProject()|

Functions for Unit Test ~

maven#getCandidateClassNameOfTest(className)			*maven#getCandidateClassNameOfTest()*
	Give you a list of candidates of file name for testing. This functionn
	would return result of |maven#getDefaultCandidateClassNameOfTest()| if it
	can't find |b:func_maven_unitest_patterns|.

	This plugin uses this function to build the list while performing
	|maven-switch-unittest-file|.

	{a:className} - The class name of source which is used to generate a list of
		candidates

	For example, when you call this function with 'Car', this function would
	return in default: >
		[
			"CarTest",
			"CarTestCase",
			"CarIT",
			"TestCar"
		]

maven#getDefaultCandidateClassNameOfTest(className)		*maven#getDefaultCandidateClassNameOfTest()*
	Give you a default list of candidates of file name for testing. This
	function is used to append default candidates while implementing
	|b:func_maven_unitest_patterns|.

	{a:className} - The class name of source which is used to generate a list
		of candidates

Miscelllaneous Functions ~

maven#slashFnamemodify(fname, mods)						*maven#slashFnamemodify*
	The synonym of |fnamemodify()|. This function would convert the
	'\'(|dos-backslash|) to slash used in UNIX system. Because this plugin
	perform lots of string-substitution, the slash/backslash convention could
	be a obstacle of implementation.

	{a:fname} - The file name to be processed
	{a:mods} - The modifiers of filename. See |filename-modifiers|

	See: |'shellslash'|, |fnamemodify()|

==============================================================================
2.4. Maven Options				*maven-plugin-options*

There are a couple options used to configure features of Maven plugin.


g:maven_auto_set_path			*maven-auto-vim-path* *g:maven_auto_set_path*
		Default value: 1

		This option would append corresponding project path to the 'path'(by
		|:setlocal|).
		The setting of 'path' would be called by |BufNewFile| or |BufReadPost|
		events of |autocommand|.

		Check |maven#getListOfPaths()| for the content of list

g:maven_auto_chdir				*maven-auto-chdir* *g:maven_auto_chdir*
		Default value: 0

		If this value is 1, this plugin would use |:lcd| to switch the current
		directory on <project_root>. This action is triggered by |BufWinEnter+|

==============================================================================
2.5. Maven Options for Unit Test	*maven-plugin-options-unittest*

While using |maven-switch-unittest-file| , this plugin would ask whether to
edit a new file if the target file of jumping doesn't exist. The
|b:maven_unitest_patterns| provides is a callback |Funcref| to customize the
possible name of source/unit test file.

*maven-unittest-candidates-file-name*
Candidate names of file ~

Since the Surefire plugin of Maven supports multiple patterns of file name for
testing in default, this plugin provides complex, customized way to handle the
the multiple candidate names of file.

If there are multiple existing candidates found, the plugin would give you a
list of existent files to be choosed by youself. Additionally, while asking to
edit a new file, the plugin shall give you a list of file names of test code.

Default condidate names of file ~

The default values of possible files are: >
	package/<ClassName>Test.java
	package/<ClassName>TestCase.java
	package/Test<ClassName>.java
	package/<ClassName>IT.java

b:func_maven_unitest_patterns		*b:func_maven_unitest_patterns* *maven-unittest-patterns*

You could implement a function which returns a list of file names. These names
would be enumerated as candidates of file name.

	Arguments:~
		{a:className}	- The name of java class(without name of package).
			For example: SomethingUtil.

	Returns:~
		You should return a |Lists| of candidates of file name.
		Note: The names of list must not contain package name/path of Java.

For example: >

	function unit_test(className)
		return [className . ".scala"]
	endfunction
<
Note: You must apply the same pattern of |b:func_maven_unitest_patterns| to
the extension of file name for editing buffer.

If you want to include default candidates of file name, you should use the
result of |maven#getDefaultCandidateClassNameOfTest()| to merge customized
names into default names, which are the default setting of Surefire of Maven.
